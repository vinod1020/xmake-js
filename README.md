## The xPack builder command line tool.

A Node.js CLI application to build xPacks.

## xPacks overview

**xPacks** are general purpose software **C/C++ packages**, intended to enhance code **sharing** and **reusing** during the development of C/C++ libraries and applications, much the same as **npm modules** do so nicely in the JavaScript ecosystem.

## Purpose

The main purpose of the `xmake` tool is to build xPacks. The approach is similar to `cmake`, just that instead of using a proprietary scripting language (with a syntax not exactly easy to parse, or even to read), it uses a JSON file, which can be easily processed by any 3rd party tools.

Functionally, `xmake` can be seen as a combination of `cMake+make`. The initial version actually generates the `make` files, and call `make`. Future versions will also import/export Eclipse CDT configurations.

## Prerequisites

If this is your first encounter with `npm`, you need to install the [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) JavScript run-time. The process is straightforward and does not pollute the system locations significantly; just pick the current version, download the package suitable for your platform and install it as usual. The result is a binary program called `node` that can be used to execute JavaScript code from the terminal, and a link called `npm`, pointing to the `npm-cli.js` script, which is part of the node module that implements the `npm` functionality. On Windows, it is recommended to first install the [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) package.

## Easy install

The module is available as [`xmake`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xmake) from the public repository; with `npm` already available, installing `xmake` is quite easy:

```console
$ sudo npm install xmake --global
```

On **Windows**, global packages are installed in the user home folder, and do not require `sudo`.

This node module provides the `xmake` executable, which is a possible reason to install it globally, although the module can also be referred as a devDependency and used in any other xPack.

The development repository is available from the GitHub [xpack/xmake-js](https://github.com/xpack/xmake-js) project.

To remove `xmake`, the command is similar:

```console
$ sudo npm uninstall xmake --global
```

(On **Windows**, `sudo` is not required).

## User info

## Metadata

`xmake` consumes `xmake.json` directly and generates `make` files. 

TODO: add a link to the JSON definition.

## Developer info

### Git repo

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/xpack/xmake-js.git xmake-js.git
$ cd xmake-js.git
$ npm install
$ sudo npm link 
$ ls -l /usr/local/lib/node_modules/
```

A link to the development folder should be present in the system `node_modules` folder, and also a link to the `xmake` executable should be available system wide.

### Tests

The tests use the [`node-tap`](http://www.node-tap.org) framework (_A Test-Anything-Protocol library for Node.js_, written by Isaac Schlueter).

As for any `npm` package, the standard way to run the project tests is via `npm test`:

```console
$ cd xmake-js.git
$ npm install
$ npm test
```

A typical test result looks like:

```console
$ npm run test

> xmake@0.3.4 test /Users/ilg/My Files/MacBookPro Projects/xPack/npm-modules/xmake-js.git
> standard && npm run test-tap -s

test/tap/010-options-common.js ...................... 24/24
test/tap/020-module-invocation.js ..................... 9/9
test/tap/030-interactive.js ......................... 12/12
test/tap/040-cmd-test.js ............................ 24/24
total ............................................... 69/69

  69 passing (3s)

  ok
```

To run a specific test with more verbose output, use `npm run tap`:

```console
$ npm run tap test/tap/010-options-common.js

> xmake@0.3.4 tap /Users/ilg/My Files/MacBookPro Projects/xPack/npm-modules/xmake-js.git
> tap --reporter=spec --timeout 300 --no-color "test/tap/010-options-common.js"

test/tap/010-options-common.js
  setup
    ✓ package ok
    ✓ version length > 0
    ✓ package xmake@0.3.4

  xmake --version (spawn)
    ✓ exit ok
    ✓ version ok
    ✓ stderr empty

  xmake -h (spawn)
    ✓ exit ok
    ✓ has Usage
    ✓ has title
    ✓ has -h|--help
    ✓ has <command> -h|--help
    ✓ has --version
    ✓ has -i|--interactive
    ✓ has log levels
    ✓ has -s|--silent
    ✓ has Bug reports:
    ✓ stderr empty

  xmake --help (spawn)
    ✓ exit ok
    ✓ has Usage
    ✓ stderr empty

  xmake -d (spawn)
    ✓ exit ok
    ✓ has stdout
    ✓ has debug
    ✓ stderr empty


  24 passing (1s)
```

### Coverage tests

Coverage tests are a good indication on how much of the source files is exercised by the tests. Ideally all source files should be covered 100%, for all 4 criteria (statements, branches, functions, lines).

To run the coverage tests, use `npm run test-coverage`:

```console
$ npm run test-coverage

> xmake@0.3.4 test-coverage /Users/ilg/My Files/MacBookPro Projects/xPack/npm-modules/xmake-js.git
> tap --coverage --reporter=classic --timeout 600 --no-color "test/tap/*.js"

test/tap/010-options-common.js ...................... 24/24
test/tap/020-module-invocation.js ..................... 9/9
test/tap/030-interactive.js ......................... 12/12
test/tap/040-cmd-test.js ............................ 24/24
total ............................................... 69/69

  69 passing (8s)

----------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------------|
```

### Continuous Integration (CI)

The continuous integration tests are performed via [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/xpack/xmake-js) (for POSIX) and [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ilg-ul/xmake-js) (for Windows).

To speed up things, the `node_modules` folder is cached between builds.

### Standard compliance

The module uses ECMAScript 6 class definitions.

As style, it uses the [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/), automatically checked at each commit via Travis CI.

Known and accepted exceptions:

- `// eslint-disable-line no-template-curly-in-string, max-len` to allow macro substitutions for `command.run`

To manually fix compliance with the style guide (where possible):

```console
$ npm run fix

> xmake@0.1.10 fix /Users/ilg/My Files/MacBookPro Projects/xPack/npm-modules/xmake-js.git
> standard --fix
```

### Documentation metadata

The documentation metadata follows the [JSdoc](http://usejsdoc.org) tags.

To enforce checking at file level, add the following comments right after the `use strict`:

```js
'use strict'
/* eslint valid-jsdoc: "error" */
/* eslint max-len: [ "error", 80, { "ignoreUrls": true } ] */
```

Note: be sure C style comments are used, C++ styles are not parsed by [ESLint](http://eslint.org).

### How to publish

* commit all changes
* `npm run test` (`fix` included)
* update `CHANGELOG.md`; commit with a message like _prepare v0.1.2_
* `npm version patch`
* push all changes to GitHub; this should trigger CI
* wait for CI tests to complete
* `npm publish`

By default, several folders are used for specific functionality

* `src` - the source folder
* `include` the include folder
* `build` - the folder where all build configurations and tests are created
* `test` - the folder where tests are searched.

Then used with xPacks, the folders can be configured to use any names, using
the `xpack.directories` definitions.

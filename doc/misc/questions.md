## profile/toolchain vs toolchain/profile?

If the target is probably undisputedly the first, what is the best order for the others?

Eclipse assigns a toolchain for each build configuration, but is this really ok?

Apparently the profiles share a common toolchain, and, as such, are variants of a given toolchain.

# Documentation pages

To hopefully ease the maintenance of the documentation pages,
the markdown files used by the Jekyll web site are kept together
with the `xmake` source files, and it is expected that by doing so
improvements in the program will also be reflected in the documentation.

## `jekyll`

The `jekyll`Â folder is exactly the content that should be available in
the `pages/xmake` folder in the `xpack.github.io-source.git`
documentation project.

TODO: decide how to implement this; it can be a git submodule and a link.

## `misc`

Miscellaneous files, most of them to be removed later.

The `inspiration.md` file lists some CMake features.
